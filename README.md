# wordcloud_uver

## Overview  
 You can use this to scrape song information on the network and use it to visualize lyrics.  
## Description  
  I like UVERworld (the Japanese Rock Band). So I make it to know why I do and introduce you to musics producted by UVERworld.  
  You can find wordclouds in ja_text or single_ja_text.  
  The former is where wordclouds of an album are and the latter is where wordclouds of a single are.
